There is a large setup violation of -3.843 ns between audio_design_i/rst_ps7_0_100M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and audio_design_i/axi_i2s_adi_0/U0/ctrl/tx_sync/rd_addr_reg[0]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_2). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
