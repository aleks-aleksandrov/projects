# Aleksandar Aleksandrov - Projects Repository 

1. **Overview**

    This a repository of some of my projects related to my Computer Engineering program at Drexel. The repository is split into several folders and each folder corresponds to a different class/theme. 

    Please note that this repository only contains a small part of my school related projects. It is a work in progress and I will keep updating and improving it!

    **Thank you for checking out my protfolio, I appreciate it!**


2. **Repository Breakdown**

    * **Computer Architecture**

        The files shared in this folder were part of my course in Computer Architecture. There are 5 different sub-projects and all of them are implemented with the goal of creating a simulation of a RISC-V based microarchitecture. There is a single cycle and a pipeline implementation. The project summary pdfs are included in every folder to give some more context to the implementations and tasks. 

    * **Shell Project**

        This project was the main focus of my Systems Programming class, which introduced me to the concepts of processes, process groups, inter-process communication, signals etc. The goal of the project was to create a simple BASH-like shell that can execute commands. The project is split into two parts and both descriptions are included in the corresponding folders.

    * **Data Structures**

        This folders contains a few of my homeworks for my class in data structures. All implementations are written in C.

    * **VHDL**

        This directory contains some of my VHDL implementations for my class in Digital Systems. All code was written in Vivado and was implemented on a BASYS 3 board.

    * **Embeded Systems**

        For my embeded systems class, I had to design hardware in Vivado and export it in the Xilinx SDK and design an embeded program for the corresponding hardware design. The directory contains some of the projects that I had to create throughout the class.
